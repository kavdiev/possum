Possum is a software for point of sales type restaurant / bar / brewery.

We recommend using Possum with a ticket printer and touch screen.

Possum used for invoicing and generates various statistics
(turnover, amount of VAT regulations totals by payment type,
number of covers, average ticket per table, ...). These statistics are calculated
per day, per week and per month and help manage trade to know the trend
sales.

It is also possible to manage playlists, you can use Possum as a jukebox
to play music.

All source code of Possum is under GPLv3 and documentation under FDL.

The key word: keep it simple for users.

History
=======

Firstly, there was a need my brother to open his
brewery. A brief state of the art showed me some interesting solutions
but often heavy and / or complicated to implement.

I was looking for something simple that I had the mastery. I
am engaged in a short development (approximately 15 days) for a first
Python/Qt3/Sqlite3 version. Today, the number of hours has grown :)
This first version has been running for almost one year without change
with a touch screen, a PC mini-ITX VIA processor and printer
to ticket.

The current name of the software came a year later with the invaluable assistance
Yvon Benoist at the time English teacher in higher education.

The first invoice output POSSUM dated 01/05/2008 at 19:28 at the brewery
**le Saint Saëns** in Rouen, Normandy, France.
